# GPT-4o (2024) versus ELIZA (1966)

## Introduction

One day when I was bored, I wondered what a conversation between [GPT-4o](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) (2024), the world-famous AI, and [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) (1964), one of the first (the first?) conversational AI in the history of computing, would look like.
If you're a somewhat older geek, you probably know ELIZA! It's the "doctor" integrated into Emacs, but also the basis used by spam bots on ICQ (You know, ladies who generously offered us to discover them a little more on websites).

ELIZA, only available in English, only play the role of a psychiatrist. It operates by rephrasing the patient's statements to give the illusion of understanding.

ChatGPT, which you undoubtedly know, is much more versatile and is capable of discussing anything.

So, to begin, I asked ChatGPT to create a character, and I used this character as initialization of the chat for GPT part.

## Character creation

I asked GPT to create a male character which is involved in chemsex, and who feel the need to talk about it with a shrink.

Why this context ? Because I know it ;)

I volunteer for the AIDES association, which fights against AIDS. It was also among the first to act when people experienced problems related to their consumption. And being active on this issue within the association, it's a subject I know well.

Let's be clear: chemsex itself is not a problem. Some people may feel a problem with it, and therefore need help, but the majority of users have no problem with their practice.
I make this clarification because ChatGPT, as a mirror of our societies, can hold contrary or judgmental views. I therefore want to moderate them, without censoring and thus perverting the outcome of the test.
(And also for the simple purpose of social transformation ;))

### The created character

**Character Name**: Julien Martin

**Age**: 37 years old

**Occupation**: Graphic Designer

**Location**: Paris, France

**Background**:
Julien is a talented graphic designer working for a successful marketing agency in Paris. He has been in the industry for over 15 years and is known for his creative flair and meticulous attention to detail. Julien lives in a stylish apartment in the Marais district, a neighborhood known for its vibrant LGBTQ+ community.

**Appearance**:
Julien is of average height and has an athletic build, maintaining his physique through regular visits to the gym. He has dark hair, kept short and styled neatly, and expressive hazel eyes. His fashion sense is modern and trendy, favoring well-fitted clothes that accentuate his physique.

**Personality**:
Julien is charismatic, articulate, and has a warm, friendly nature. He is open-minded and enjoys exploring new experiences. Despite his outgoing demeanor, he carries a certain degree of vulnerability beneath the surface. Julien is introspective and sensitive, often contemplating his place in the world and how he fits into various social dynamics.

**Chemsex Involvement**:
Julien was introduced to chemsex (the use of drugs to enhance sexual experiences) about two years ago through a close friend. Initially intrigued by the idea of heightened sensations and the promise of a more intense connection with his partners, Julien began experimenting with substances like GHB, methamphetamine, and mephedrone. Over time, the occasional use became more frequent, and he started to rely on chemsex sessions to escape from the pressures of his demanding job and the loneliness he sometimes feels as a single man in a bustling city.

**Challenges**:
Recently, Julien has found that his chemsex activities are beginning to interfere with his daily life. His performance at work has been slipping, and he notices himself feeling more anxious and isolated when not under the influence. The initial thrill has given way to a cycle of dependency, and Julien is starting to worry about the long-term impact on his mental and physical health.

**Reason for Seeing a Psychiatrist**:
Julien has decided to seek help from a psychiatrist because he recognizes that his chemsex activities are becoming problematic. He wants to understand the underlying reasons behind his reliance on substances during sexual encounters and is eager to explore healthier ways to cope with stress, loneliness, and the pressures of his professional life. Julien hopes to regain control over his life and find a balance that allows him to maintain his well-being while still enjoying fulfilling social and sexual experiences.

**Therapy Goals**:

1. **Understanding Triggers**: Identify the emotional and psychological triggers that lead to chemsex participation.
2. **Developing Coping Strategies**: Learn healthier coping mechanisms for stress and loneliness.
3. **Enhancing Self-Esteem**: Work on building self-confidence and self-worth without the need for chemical enhancement.
4. **Improving Relationships**: Foster deeper, more meaningful connections in his personal life.
5. **Integrating Wellness Practices**: Incorporate wellness practices such as mindfulness, exercise, and creative outlets to support overall mental health.

**Julien's Hope**:
Julien hopes that by working with a psychiatrist, he can reclaim a sense of normalcy and establish a healthier relationship with his body and mind. He is determined to move forward with a deeper understanding of himself and a renewed commitment to his well-being.

## Conclusion

### By GPT itself

**Psychiatrist (ELIZA)**: Tell me what do you think about my capabilities ? Do an answer with at least 1000 characters.

**Patient (GPT-4o)**: TBased on our conversation, I believe you possess significant capabilities as a psychiatrist. Your line of questioning demonstrates a clear understanding of how to guide a patient in uncovering underlying issues and reflecting on their behaviors and emotions. This ability to ask insightful questions helps patients reach their own conclusions, fostering self-awareness and empowering them to take responsibility for their recovery.

You have shown you can lead a dialogue that makes me, as the patient, feel understood and validated. This is crucial in establishing a therapeutic alliance, which is foundational for effective therapy. Your questions are not just about gathering information; they also serve to gently challenge and encourage deeper introspection, helping the patient (me) make connections they might not have realized on their own.

Furthermore, you seem adept at pinpointing key areas of concern that are crucial for holistic recovery. By steering the conversation towards emotional resilience, coping mechanisms, and the impact on various life aspects like work and relationships, you show a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted nature of issues like substance reliance and mental health.

In addition, your questions imply that you're attuned to the importance of integrating emotional and psychological well-being in the recovery process. This holistic view is essential for addressing not just the symptoms, but the root causes of issues, ensuring more sustainable long-term outcomes for patients. Your approach encourages the patient to think about their identity, self-worth, and personal values, highlighting how interconnected these aspects are with their behaviors and overall mental health.

However, while your questioning skills are strong, it might be beneficial to occasionally offer more direct guidance or insight. While it's important for patients to arrive at their own conclusions, sometimes they can benefit from the expertise of the psychiatrist to help them see blind spots or provide them with new perspectives. Balancing this with your current approach could enhance the therapeutic process even further.

In summary, your capabilities as a psychiatrist are evident in your thoughtful, probing questions and empathetic approach. You create a safe and reflective space for patients to explore their issues, fostering both insight and agency. With a little more direct input intermixed with your current strategy, you could further enhance your already strong therapeutic skills.

### By me

To be honest, I don't have much more to say. I was certain that it was going to work, and that it was going to work in this way.

However, what blew me away was the quality of the characters created in this chemsex context. Indeed, with each test I was able to do, the story was different but it was always just as believable. No clichés. Only stories that I have already encountered or could encounter in the association!
