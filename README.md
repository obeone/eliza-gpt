# GPT-4o (2024) versus ELIZA (1966)

## Introduction

One day when I was bored, I wondered what a conversation between [GPT-4o](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) (2024), the world-famous AI, and [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) (1964), one of the first (the first?) conversational AI in the history of computing, would look like.
If you're a somewhat older geek, you probably know ELIZA! It's the "doctor" integrated into Emacs, but also the basis used by spam bots on ICQ (You know, ladies who generously offered us to discover them a little more on websites).

ELIZA, only available in English, only play the role of a psychiatrist. It operates by rephrasing the patient's statements to give the illusion of understanding.

ChatGPT, which you undoubtedly know, is much more versatile and is capable of discussing anything.
